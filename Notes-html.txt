HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
  Defines content - structure - meaning of webpages

www - World Wide Web

Hypertext - text that is interactive. Contains link to navigate. 
  Hyper - skips normal reading flow to jump to other pieces of text

Markup Language - "marking up" text (give it a special meaning)

HTML is not a programming language ( no logic )


Writing HTML

1. Document type declaration
    - represent version of HTML being used. In this case: html5
    - Other version are too verbose (expressed in too many words)
    
    <DOCTYPE! html>

2. Laying out document
      - Root Element:  <html></html>
          - defines whole HTML document. 
      - <> </>: starting and ending tag. [tag: represents an element in source code]
              Two kinds of elements: 
                  Container Elements:      has starting + ending tags
                  Non-container Elements:  only starting tags
        
3. Two main parts of HTML document
      - Meta Information: <head></head>
          - Document information
      - Content: <body></body>
          - What is rendered
      
Common HTML elements:
        <h1></h1>: main heading. Runs from h1 --> h6

        <p></p>: paragraph

        <a></a>: anchor. Connects two points. hyperlink in HTML

        <title></title>: document title. Seen on search engines and browser tab.
              - Used by search engines as the heading to display in SERPS (Search Engine Results Page)



Attributes: traits of HTML element
  <a href="https://google.com/">Google Link</a>
        - href: hyper reference. 
        - For a remote resource a fully qualified URL is needed. (https) [scheme of URL]


Coding style guide:
        1. Lowercase tag name.
          <html><title>...
        2. Indent nested elements.
        3. No space between attribute name and value
            <a href="no space">
        4. Quote attribute values
