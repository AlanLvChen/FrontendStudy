HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
  Defines content - structure - meaning of webpages

www - World Wide Web

Hypertext - text that is interactive. Contains link to navigate. 
  Hyper - skips normal reading flow to jump to other pieces of text

Markup Language - "marking up" text (give it a special meaning)
  Language - formal syntax and grammatical rules

HTML is not a programming language ( no logic )


Writing HTML

1. Document type declaration
    - represent version of HTML being used. In this case: html5
    - Other version are too verbose (expressed in too many words)
    
    <DOCTYPE! html>

2. Laying out document
      - Root Element:  <html></html>
          - defines whole HTML document. 
      - <> </>: starting and ending tag. [tag: represents an element in source code]
              Two kinds of elements: 
                  Container Elements:      has starting + ending tags
                  Non-container Elements:  only starting tags
        
3. Two main parts of HTML document
      - Meta Information: <head></head>
          - Document information
      - Content: <body></body>
          - What is rendered
      
Common HTML elements:
        <h1></h1>: main heading. Runs from h1 --> h6

        <p></p>: paragraph

        <a></a>: anchor. Connects two points. hyperlink in HTML

        <title></title>: document title. Seen on search engines and browser tab.
              - Used by search engines as the heading to display in SERPS (Search Engine Results Page)



Attributes: traits of HTML element
  <a href="https://google.com/">Google Link</a>
        - href: hyper reference. 
        - For a remote resource a fully qualified URL is needed. (https) [scheme of URL]


Coding style guide:
        1. Lowercase tag name.
          <html><title>...
        2. Indent nested elements.
        3. No space between attribute name and value
            <a href="no space">
        4. Quote attribute values
              


HTML Text

  Headings
    <h1> <h2>  <h3>  <h4>  <h5>  <h6>
    - Reccommended to have exactly one <h1> element on a webpage

  Paragraphs
    <p>
    - contains vertical margins around them to space out from other paragraphs

  Bold and Italicize
      <strong>: text is strong importance (bold)
      <em>:     text is emphasized        (italicized)

      Similarly
      <b>:  bold
      <i>:  italics

      Difference is semantic HTML. <b> and <i> are exclusively visual styling. Has no meaning

      <i> or <em>
          - <i> for icons. <em> for italics.
      <b> or <strong>
          - <b> for text bold. <strong> for important text


  Superscript and Subscript
      <sup>: x^2
      <sub>: x_2


  Line breaks
      <br>: introduces a line break. Only be used for new lines within a block of text.
          - Use <p> if it wants a new block of text

          In HTML, sequences of whitespace are replaced by a single space in output.


  HTML Lists
      <ol>:  ordered lists. Numbered
      <ul>:  unordered lists. Bulleted
          
          
      Child element of <ol> and <ul>:
          <li>: list item. Should only be used in <ol> or <ul>
  
      <ol> and <ul> should only contain <li>

      Speecial attributes for <ol>
      <ol reversed>: 1-->3 becomes 3-->1
      <ol type="i">: Specify numbering type 
          "a":  a,b,c    "1":  1,2,3      "I":  I,II,III
          "A":  A,B,C    "i":  i,ii,iii
      <ol start="10">: numbering always begin at number given. EVEN if reversed
        

      
      Nesting Lists
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Languages</p>
            <ul>
              <li>English</li>
              <li>Spanish</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>


    HTML Advanced Text

        <pre>:   preformatting
            <pre>This is    spaced-out     text.</pre>
            Issue: renders text with monospaced font. since code is in monospaced.
            <pre style="font-family: inherit">This is    spaced-out     text.<pre>
            Solution: font-family to inherit font family on the parent of <pre>

            In practice, preserving whitespace in a <p>, just use CSS to style.
          

        <dfn>:   contains term being defined 
            <p>A <dfn>data type</dfn> is a set of values along with the operations possible on 
            those values.</p>
            - The text surrounding <dfn> must define the term

        <abbr>:  abbreviations. Applies dotted underline
            <p>HTML <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.</p>
            Just have one <abbr> at where the abbreviation occurs first


        <mark>:  highlighting text

        <s>:     strike-through text

        <ins>:  denote any insertion of text (styled with underline)
        <del>:  denote any deletion (styled with strike-through)
              - Attribute - datetime - represents date/time which insert/delete was done
              - Can nest <ins><del>. add then remove item


        <s> or <del>: 
            - <s>:   text wasn't or can't be literally deleted
            - <del>: text has or been literally deleted


        <q> and <blockquote>:
          <q>: simple, inline quotations
          <blockquote>: separate block.
              Attribute - cite - contains link to resource where text is quoted

        <cite>: Contains titles/names of given information (typically italicized). 


  HTML entities:  (character reference)
    - sequence of multiple characters, as a unit, denotes a single character in output.
    - begins with & and ends with ;

    To display < (less than). Use %lt;
        <p>2 &lt; 3</p>

    --> Named entity: HTML entity with a name. 
    --> Numeric entity: HTML entity using numeric codes

  Commonly used entities:

      1. Non-breaking spaces
            &nbsp;
            - RULE 1: Not a regular whitespace character. Remains in output as it is in code
            - RULE 2: Does not allow breaking of text (text wrapping to next line if too long)
                      Groups two words into one. 

      2. less-than (<) and greater-than (>)
            <p>This is &lt;code&gt;</p>

      3. Ampersand (&)
            To Show literal text &gt; -- use &amp; 
            <p>Greater-than (&amp;gt;)</p>


  <code>
    -  Wraps code to convert to monospace font 
    -  Meant for inline code
    -  For blocks of code, wrap <code> in <pre>

  <samp>: 'sample output'
    -  represents textual output of generated by a computer program
    -  Meant for inline code
    -  <pre> for block of output

        <p>The <code>print(11 ** 2)</code> function call in Python outputs <samp>121</samp>.</p>
